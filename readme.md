# Alias to create a mane of an existing type

# Can we use a type alias describe a shape instead of an instance

but semantically better would be to use interface to describe a shape, and only if we cannot use an interface to describe some shape, we can use a type alias
-> \*chỉ nên dùng khi không dùng được interface
